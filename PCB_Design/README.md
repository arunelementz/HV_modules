## HV Schematic and PCB Design Notes

- Schematic is the same as the original **CN0536 board**, including all annotations.
- **Sound notification** is **not included** in the PCB design.
- **BOM** is based on the original **CN0536 BOM**.
- **R19 and R20** are changed to **30 MΩ**  
  - Note: CN0536 BOM specifies **30 MΩ**, but a **different value appears in the schematic** and needs verification.
- **CN0536 stack arrangement** differs and should follow the reference shown.


- **Footprints to be confirmed**:
  - L1  
  - R9  
  - U1  
  - U5
- **Edge cuts** and **high-voltage trace clearance** need to be confirmed.
- **Potentiometer pin numbering** in schematic symbols has been checked.
- **Polygons** are used for drawing copper zones.
